            Bring me back to life
            Never let me go

            Your troubles and your heart strife
            I saw them

            Take me by the hand
            As we cross through battlefields
            
            Nobody understands
            'Cause there's nobody at the wheel
            
            Beautiful James
            I don't wanna wake you
            
            Beautiful James
            I don't wanna wake you
            
            Everybody lies
            One-hundred times a day
            
            The silence in your hard eyes
            Is far too rare to give away
            And it's exactly why I stay
            
            Beautiful James
            I don't wanna wake you
            
            Beautiful James
            I don't wanna wake you (don't wanna wake you)
            Beautiful James (don't wanna wake you)
            I don't wanna wake you (don't wanna wake you)
            Beautiful James (don't wanna wake you)
            I don't wanna wake you
            Though I may have to
            I may have to
            I may have to
            
            Beautiful James
            I don't wanna wake you (don't wanna wake you)
            Beautiful James (don't wanna wake you)
            I don't wanna wake you (don't wanna wake you)
            Beautiful James (don't wanna wake you)
            I don't wanna wake you
